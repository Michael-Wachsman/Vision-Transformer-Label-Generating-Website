# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Before starting the frontend for the first time, don't forget to run these lines in the terminal:
npm  install @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled
npm install axios
npm install recharts

In the client_side directory, you can run: `npm start` to start the frontend
